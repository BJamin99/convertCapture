# convertCapture
Convert Presonus StudioLive SD card capture to a Studio One/Capture compatible capture.

This has been tested with a capture from StudioLive Series III 32 mixer and Studio One 4 Professional.

Note that to import Fat Channel settings, the Fat Channel XT plugin is needed.  This is included in Studio One Artist and Professional.  It can be purchased for Studio One Prime.
